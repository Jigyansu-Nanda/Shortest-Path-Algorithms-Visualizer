# Shortest Path Algorithms Visualizer
Live version of this web application: [Shortest Path Algorithms Visualizer.](https://jigyansu-nanda.github.io/Shortest-Path-Algorithms-Visualizer/) <br/><br/>
Welcome to Shortest Path Algorithms Visualizer. This is a visualization tool to help you visualize how the algorithms, used for solving Shortest Path Problem, work in real time. [Shortest Path Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) in graph theory, is a [Combinatorial Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization) problem. The problem requires one, to find a path between a source vertex and a destination vertex, such that travelling through the found path, costs the least. The weight attributed to any edge between two vertices in the graph, is considered as cost of travelling between those two vertices. This visualizer implements 4 shortest path finding algorithms
 
  - For unweighted Graph
    - Breadth First Search
  - For weighted Graph
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Bellman Ford Algorithm
    - Floyd Warshall Algorithm
    
The Visualizer computes the shortest path between two source and destination vertices on a 2-D Grid. Here, the graph can be visualized as 2-D grid, with each cell of the grid as a possible vertex of graph and the values represented by each cell represents the cost of travelling through that vertex.
